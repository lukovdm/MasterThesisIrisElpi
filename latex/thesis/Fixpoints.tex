\chapter{Fixpoints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    \item We will be modeling our inductive as the least fix-point of a functor
\end{itemize}
\section{Functor}
\section{Monotone}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are we proving, what is Monotone
    \item This can be seen as a proper
    \item We have to transform proper to Iris Propositions
    \item Respectful, point-wise, persistent
    \item Define Proper instances for connectives
    \item How to find proper instance
    \item IProperTop
    \item Example of Proper proof
\end{itemize}
\section{Least fix-point}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Banach fixed point theorem
    \item Intuition about what the least fix-point is
    \item The least fix-point of a functor holds for a value if for all fix-points of the functor the value holds
    \item What does our fix-point function create
    \item Example for is_list
\end{itemize}
\section{Unfold Lemma's}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allows for more easy reasoning about fix-points by using the functor
    \item Essential in following proofs
\end{itemize}
