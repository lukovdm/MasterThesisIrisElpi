\section{Other projects using Elpi}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{tassiDerivingProvedEquality2019} Derive
    \item \cite{blotCompositionalPreprocessingAutomated2023} Trakt
    \item \cite{cohenHierarchyBuilderAlgebraic2020} Hierarchy builder
    \item Troq
\end{itemize}

\section{Fixpoints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{brotherstonFormalisedInductiveReasoning2007,brotherstonCyclicProofsProgram2008} Defines inductive predicates in a BI logic \quest{What is this exactly? I know Iris is one?}. Follows simliar steps, fiven a pre fixpoint function, called an operator. Proves it monotone and then takes the least fixpoint. \quest{I don't understand how it generates the function, because it seems to do so.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Inductive predicates in other separation logic proof systems}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{caoVSTFloydSeparationLogic2018} mentions representation predicates and shows how to define simple variants. Only works when it has a strictly decreasing recursive call.
    \item \cite{berdineSmallfootModularAutomatic2005} is a tool for checking a subset of separation logic specifications. It includes several built in representation predicates. You are not able to define more.
    \item \cite{leinoDafnyAutomaticProgram2010} uses an SMT based automatic program verifier, with added hints if necessary. It automatically can handle recursive data types and do induction on them.
    \item \cite{filliatreOneLogicUse2013} They support inductive predicates. But doesn't use separation logic I think.
    \item \cite{mullerViperVerificationInfrastructure2016,summersAutomatingDeductiveVerification2018} Viper, is based on separation logic. It allows for automatic definition of inductive predicates. Not clear how, never explained as far as I can tell.
    \item \cite{jacobsVeriFastPowerfulSound2011} is based on separation logic.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Embedded things}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{appelTacticsSeparationLogic} Uses Coq inductive directly. This only works if the PROP you are working in is a concrete sort, often heap to Prop. iProp uses a record as PROP, thus does not work. But we even define it for the BI logic, which is not concrete at all.
    \item \cite{chlipalaMostlyautomatedVerificationLowlevel2011} Bedrock, uses Coq fixpoint I think
    \item \cite{bengtsonCharge2012} Charge, also Coq fixpoint, but need to read further.
    \item \cite{appelProgramLogicsCertified2014} Need to read
    \item \cite{rouvoetIntrinsicallyTypedCompilation2021} Also concrete Prop, and uses inductive, but in Agda
\end{itemize}

\section{Generalized rewriting, Propers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{sozeauNewLookGeneralized2009} Generalized rewriting. They backtrack in their proof search, we do not.
\end{itemize}

\section{Other IPM implementations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MTac2
    \item LTac2
    \item Lean
\end{itemize}
